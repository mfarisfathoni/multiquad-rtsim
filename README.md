# multiquad_rtsim

Notes from author:
This is some source codes of multi-quadrotor real-time simulation.
This code is an additional resources for author's paper entitled "Efficient Group-Drones Flight Strategies for Avoiding Obstacles"
The code is not complete, it is only to show how to implement particular functions on the paper (Algorithm 3, 4, 5, 6). 
Codes included in this repository: main program, collision avoidance.
